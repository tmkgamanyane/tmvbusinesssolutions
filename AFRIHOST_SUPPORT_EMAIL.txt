SUBJECT: Enable Remote MySQL and SMTP Access for tmvbusinesssolutions.co.za

---

Hello Afrihost Support Team,

I need to enable remote access for both MySQL database and SMTP email services for my hosting account.

ACCOUNT DETAILS:
- Domain: tmvbusinesssolutions.co.za
- Database Name: tmvbusinesssolutions
- Database User: root (or tmvbusinesssolutions)
- Email Account: enquiries@tmvbusinesssolutions.co.za

REQUEST 1: Enable Remote MySQL Access
- Current MySQL Host: mysql.afrihost.com
- Port: 3306
- Issue: Getting "ENOTFOUND mysql.afrihost.com" when connecting from external server
- Needed for: Backend API hosted on Render.com to access the database
- Please enable remote connections from all IP addresses (0.0.0.0/0)

REQUEST 2: Enable Remote SMTP Access
- Current SMTP Host: mail.afrihost.com
- Port: 587 (STARTTLS)
- Email: enquiries@tmvbusinesssolutions.co.za
- Issue: Getting "Connection timeout" when sending emails from external server
- Needed for: Automated emails (user registrations, notifications, contact forms)
- Please allow remote SMTP connections from all IP addresses

BACKGROUND:
I'm running a Node.js backend application on Render.com that needs to:
1. Connect to the MySQL database hosted on Afrihost
2. Send emails via SMTP using Afrihost's mail server

The application is currently live but cannot access either service due to firewall/remote access restrictions.

SECURITY NOTE:
- Database is already protected by username/password authentication
- SMTP requires authentication (username: enquiries@tmvbusinesssolutions.co.za, password: [secure])
- Both connections use secure protocols (TLS/SSL)

Could you please enable remote access for both services and confirm when complete?

Thank you for your assistance!

Best regards,

ALTERNATIVE: If there's a control panel option to enable this myself (cPanel Remote MySQL / Email settings), 
please let me know where to find it.
